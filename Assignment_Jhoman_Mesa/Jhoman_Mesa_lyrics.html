            <h3>Lyrics:</h3>
            <p>
                I can't remember when you weren't there<br>
                When I didn't care for anyone but you<br>
                I swear, we've been through everything there is<br>
                Can't imagine anything we've missed<br>
                Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do<br><br>
                
                Through the years, you've never let me down<br>
                You've turned my life around<br>
                The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you<br>
                Through the year, I've never been afraid<br>
                I've loved the life we've made<br>
                And I'm so glad I've stayed right here with you<br>
                Through the years<br><br>
                
                I can't remember what I used to do<br>
                Who I trusted, whom I listened to before<br>
                I swear, you've taught me everything I know<br>
                Can't imagine needing someone so<br>
                But through the years it seems to me<br>
                I need you more and more<br><br>
                
                Through the years, through all the good and bad<br>
                I knew how much we had<br>
                I've always been so glad to be with you<br>
                Through the years, it's better every day<br>
                You've kissed my tears away<br>
                As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you<br>
                Through the years<br><br>
                
                Through the years, when everything went wrong<br>
                Together we were strong<br>
                I know that I belonged right here with you<br>
                Through the years, I never had a doubt<br>
                We'd always work things out<br>
                I've learned what love's about, by loving you<br>
                Through the years<br><br>
                
                Through the years, you've never let me down<br>
                You've turned my life around<br>
                The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you<br>
                Through the years, it's better every day<br>
                You've kissed my tears away<br>
                As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you<br>
                Through the years
